__Easily write GUI Tests in Java__

abego GuiTesting is a library to make it easy for Java developers 
to write tests involving graphical user interfaces (GUIs), like 
Swing windows and dialogs.

Use the GuiTesting library to quickly write GUI tests in the same way 
you write "faceless" JUnit tests.
